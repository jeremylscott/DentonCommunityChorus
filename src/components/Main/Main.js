                Since 1970, the Denton Community Chorus has been striving to
                present quality choral music to the Denton community. Our mission
                is to educate the members in the art and technique of fine choral
                music and to offer this opportunity to all adults of the Greater
                Denton area, and to provide the community at large opportunities
                to experience fine choral music.
